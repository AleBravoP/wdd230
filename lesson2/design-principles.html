            <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
            <h4><a href="http://www.ofmonstersandmen.com/" target="_blank">Of Monsters and Men</a></h4>

            <p>The website of the Icelandic band Of Monsters and Men, is a great example of the use of white space and clean 
                design. Only the most relevant elements are displayed, such as social media buttons, album titles and covers. 
                As you scroll down through the site there is a feeling of spaciousness which could be partly attributed to 
                the color scheme, however, the main factor that creates this effect is the layout of the objects, allowing 
                the eye to “rest” between the content while keeping it consistent.</p>

            <h3>PARC: Alignment</h3>
            <h4><a href="http://somosbiotopia.com/" target="_blank">Biotopía</a></h4>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/biotopia.jpg" alt="Biotopia mobile site view">
            </figure>
            <p>Biotopía, a popular fiction podcast about a scientific community, as part of their advertising campaign, 
                created a website with the main plot information. In the index page we can see applied the second of the 
                P.A.R.C. principles applied: alignment. In the mobile view we find the spotify streaming card center-aligned 
                as well as all the text and pictures. In the desktop version, besides the centered alignment, there are 
                blocks of text lined up with pictures. Keeping the elements disposed this way creates order to visually 
                understand each part of the page.</p>

            <h3>PARC: Contrast</h3>
            <h4><a href="https://olafurarnalds.com/" target="_blank">Ólafur Arnalds</a></h4>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/arnalds.jpg" alt="Olafur Arnalds mobile site view">
            </figure>
            <p>One of the main design principles is contrast, having elements in different colors and shades has a direct 
            impact in the ease to view and read a website. In the music composer Ólafur Arnalds’ site, the contrast 
            principle is well implemented as the dark background color is perfect for the white and golden text to 
            stand out. This is a great example of contrast as the principle is also applied with the pictures among 
            the site, even though the photographs have an overall dark lighting, the whites and illumination is 
            accurately set to blend with the rest of the page but having some elements easily catch the eyes 
            attention. </p>
